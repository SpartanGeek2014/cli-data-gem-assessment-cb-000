# My Ruby CLI project for Flatiron School

After going through the various assignment options, I decided to use my personal love of movies and create a
CLI project that will pull various chosen movies from the Fandango.com website, which is updated frequently and I've yet
to have them give bad showtimes, summary, and video trailer information for movies and theaters in my area.

# WHAT WILL IT DO?

You can enter in the title of a movie and pull the available summary, actors' names, director, writer, and other
pertinent information.

# HOW TO LAUNCH

gem install now-playing

This should launch the Ruby Gem installation sequence and it seems to take about 2 to 5 minutes, depending on your
processor speeds and internet connection speeds. Once its installed, in an IRB environment, you should be able to call it
as *./bin/now-playing*

By entering a number, for the list position that your movie falls into, you can see its title, summary, and the IMDB site
URL address where a more detailed page is located.
